      "I love to paint with watercolors, but I also do a lot with acrylic.  You can see in this section how my love of animals inspires so much of my art. Some of these paintings are commissioned pet portraits from other animal lovers, and some are professional works I have done for clients, including one of the children's books I illustrated. My favorite work here might be from the Dragon Boat Festival in Nashville where my design was picked for one of the official posters of the event!",

      "Ask anyone who knows me, and they will tell you how much I enjoy doing photoshoots.  Whether it is exploring nature and finding lots of critters or dressing up my friends and family in wild costumes so they can be models.  I have even done more serious work like senior portraits and professional profile pictures.  Of course, you can't forget the countless pictures of my cats and all the kittens I foster.  I just love to find something beautiful and capture it with photography.",

      "I have always been drawing or doodling and I have filled countless sketchbooks in my life.  Between the sketches, graphic novellas, children's books, and even some branding work, I have narrowed it down to just the favorites.  Colored pencil and graphite are my primary media, and my signature sketch is my dahlia flower, which is present in so much of my drawing.  Nature and fantasy are huge inspirations for the work that I do, and I would probably draw dragons and flowers all day if I could!",

      "When I got to college it was time to take on a new challenge in my artistic development.  The idea of digital art was outside my realm, but it was required for my degree in Commercial Illustration.  That isn't to say that I didn't have a ton of fun learning and creating in this new medium!  I especially enjoyed digital painting, but I also became an experienced vector-art designer and even did some 3d modeling.  In my career I designed logos, business cards, car wraps, and just about everything in print media.",
