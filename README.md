A full stack application for an artist to keep all her favorite artworks from her many disciplines in one place.

### Technology Stack

- Express
- EJS
- Google Cloud Storage
- MongoDB

## Description of Application

Keeping all of her art in different social media profiles was too much to organize, and made it difficult to show potential employers and clients her work and skillset. This application was designed to have all her work organized in one central location and to allow her to make changes as necessary.

Now, she can direct anyone to her site, and they can easily see what they're looking for.

The artist can login to create, read, update, and delete any artwork on the site. The UI automatically lays out any new or updated art into pages and sections organized by medium and category, and removes the deleted items.
